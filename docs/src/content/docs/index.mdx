<Aside type="tip" title="Not Another Database">
  We're not building a database to compete with PostgreSQL. We're documenting the journey of
  learning how PostgreSQL works by building our own. If you need a database, use PostgreSQL. If you
  want to understand databases, join us!

## Current Reality Check

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="What Works Today">
    <Badge text="HONEST STATUS" variant="success" />
    
    - ‚úÖ **WAL Implementation** - Crash recovery actually works!
    - ‚úÖ **Concurrent Skip List** - Real lock-free data structure
    - ‚úÖ **SSTable Writer & Reader** - Can persist and read sorted data
    - ‚úÖ **Blog & Tutorials** - Learn alongside us

<TabItem label="What Doesn't Exist">
  <Badge text="NOT BUILT YET" variant="caution" />- ‚ùå **No Server** - Can't run FerrisDB - ‚ùå **No
  Storage Engine** - Components not connected - ‚ùå **No Queries** - Can't get/put data - ‚ùå **No
  Distribution** - Single node only We're building in public - watch it happen!
