## System Architecture

FerrisDB is being built as a distributed, transactional key-value database. Currently, we're focused on the storage engine layer.

## Component Status

### ✅ Completed Components

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Write-Ahead Log (WAL)" icon="document">
    - 64-byte file headers with versioning
    - CRC32 checksums for integrity
    - Zero-copy reads with BytesMutExt
    - Comprehensive metrics collection
    - 153 tests ensuring reliability
  </Card>

<Card title="MemTable (Skip List)" icon="list">
  - Lock-free concurrent reads - Fine-grained write locking - MVCC timestamp support - Efficient
  O(log n) operations
</Card>

  <Card title="SSTable Format" icon="document">
    - Binary format with blocks
    - Index for efficient lookups
    - Footer with metadata
    - Reader with binary search
    - Writer for persistence
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### 🚧 In Progress

- **Storage Engine Integration**: Connecting WAL, MemTable, and SSTables into a cohesive system
- **Compaction**: Background process to merge SSTables

### 📋 Planned Components

- **Server Layer**: gRPC-based network protocol
- **Client Library**: Rust client for applications
- **Transaction Coordinator**: ACID transaction support
- **Distribution Layer**: Sharding and replication

## Design Principles

### 1. Educational First

Every component is designed to teach database concepts:

- Clear, understandable code
- Extensive documentation
- Real-world patterns without unnecessary complexity

### 2. Modular Architecture

Each component has:

- Single responsibility
- Well-defined interfaces
- Clear boundaries
- Minimal dependencies

### 3. Safety and Correctness

- Safe Rust practices (minimal unsafe)
- Comprehensive testing
- Property-based tests where applicable
- Metrics for observability

## Component Details

### Storage Engine (LSM-Tree)

We chose LSM-tree architecture because:

- **Write optimized**: Append-only writes are fast
- **Educational value**: Demonstrates compaction, bloom filters, levels
- **Real-world relevance**: Used by RocksDB, Cassandra, many others

Current implementation:

- Sequential writes to WAL for durability
- In-memory writes to MemTable for speed
- Periodic flush to immutable SSTables
- Background compaction (coming soon)

### Concurrency Model

- **MemTable**: Lock-free reads, fine-grained write locks
- **WAL**: Single writer, thread-safe
- **SSTable**: Immutable after creation
- **Future**: Multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)

### File Formats

All binary formats follow consistent patterns:

- Magic numbers: `FDB_XXX\0` pattern
- 64-byte headers for cache alignment
- CRC32 checksums for integrity
- Little-endian encoding
- Version fields for compatibility

## Development Status

This is an educational project in active development:

- Components work individually
- Integration in progress
- Not suitable for production use
- Focus on learning and clarity

For our vision of the complete system, see [Future Architecture](/reference/future-architecture/).
