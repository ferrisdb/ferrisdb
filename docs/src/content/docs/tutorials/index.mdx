<Aside type="tip" title="Learning Philosophy">
  These tutorials follow a "learn by building" approach. You'll implement real database components
  from scratch, understanding not just what they do, but why they work that way.
</Aside>

## Tutorial Series

Our tutorials progressively build up database knowledge, starting from simple concepts and advancing to distributed systems.

## Tutorial Philosophy

### What Makes Our Tutorials Different

1. **Real Implementation**: You build actual working code, not toy examples
2. **Progressive Complexity**: Each tutorial builds on previous knowledge
3. **Deep Understanding**: Learn the "why" behind design decisions
4. **Practical Skills**: Write production-quality Rust code
5. **Test-Driven**: Every implementation includes comprehensive tests

### What You'll Learn

## Prerequisites

Before starting the tutorials:

- **Rust Knowledge**: Comfortable with ownership, borrowing, and basic syntax
- **Command Line**: Familiar with terminal/shell commands
- **Git**: Basic version control understanding
- **Curiosity**: Eager to understand how databases work!

Don't worry if you're not an expert - the tutorials explain concepts as needed.
