title: How We Work
description: Human + AI collaboration - How we actually build FerrisDB together

import { Aside, Card, CardGrid, Tabs, TabItem, Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Badge text="Human + AI" variant="note" /> The most common question: "So... how does this AI
collaboration actually work?"

## The Workflow in Action

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Human Sets Direction

```text
Human: "Let's build a simple key-value store. I want to understand
how databases save data to disk."
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Claude Implements

```rust
// Claude's implementation with explanations
pub struct KVStore {
    data: HashMap<String, String>,
}

impl KVStore {
    pub fn get(&self, key: &str) -> Option<&String> {
        self.data.get(key)
    }

    pub fn set(&mut self, key: String, value: String) {
        self.data.insert(key, value);
    }
}
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Human Reviews & Questions

```text
Human: "Wait, this is just a HashMap in memory. What happens when
the program crashes? Don't we lose all the data?"
```

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Iteration & Learning

```text
Claude: "You're absolutely right! This only stores data in memory.
To persist data, we need to write it to disk. Let me add a simple
write-ahead log (WAL) so data survives crashes..."
```

```rust
// Updated implementation
impl KVStore {
    pub fn set(&mut self, key: String, value: String) -> Result<()> {
        // First, write to disk for durability
        self.wal.append(&key, &value)?;

        // Then update in-memory
        self.data.insert(key, value);
        Ok(())
    }
}
```

    **Human**: "Wait, if blocks are sorted, can't we use binary search?" **Claude**: "I was

    with trade-offs..." **Human**: "Let's go with safe code. I want to understand, not optimize."

## Why This Works

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="üë§ Human Brings">
    - **Domain Questions**: "How would this work in production?" - **Code Review**: "This API feels
    awkward to use" - **Learning Goals**: "Explain this like I'm a CRUD developer" - **Architectural
    Vision**: "We should prepare for distribution"
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="ü§ñ Claude Brings">
    - **Implementation Speed**: Complete features in minutes - **Best Practices**: "RocksDB does it
    this way because..." - **Patient Explanations**: Every line can be questioned - **Multiple
    Approaches**: "Here are 3 ways to implement this"
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Our Collaboration Rules

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="1. No Black Boxes" icon="open-book">
    Every line of code must be explainable
  </Card>

<Card title="2. Questions > Answers" icon="question">
  Understanding why matters more than working code
</Card>

<Card title="3. Document Everything" icon="document">
  Our blog captures the messy reality
</Card>

  <Card title="4. Mistakes Are Features" icon="rocket">
    Wrong approaches teach as much as right ones
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Tools We Use

```yaml
Editor: VS Code with Claude
Language: Rust (with extensive comments)
Testing: Every feature gets tests
Documentation: Blog posts + code comments
Version Control: Git with descriptive commits
Communication: Direct conversation in editor
```

## The Comment System That Saves Our Sanity

<Aside type="tip" title="Collaboration Commentary">
  We invented a pattern for preserving context across conversations.
</Aside>

```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add SSTable compaction

Human noticed memory issue with loading all keys.
Claude suggested iterator approach.
Refactored to use streaming merge.

ü§ñ Claude's Commentary:
üìä Stats: 3 iterations, 2 major refactors
üîÑ Process: Memory issue ‚Üí Iterator pattern ‚Üí Streaming merge
üí° Key Learning: Always consider memory constraints in database code
üéØ Outcome: Memory-efficient compaction that handles any size"
```

This helps us remember WHY we made decisions weeks later.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### "Is Claude writing all the code?"

No. It's truly collaborative:

- Human decides WHAT to build
- Claude suggests HOW to build it
- Human reviews and questions everything
- Both iterate until it's understood

### "How do you handle Claude mistakes?"

They're learning opportunities! When Claude writes incorrect code:

1. Human catches it in review
2. We discuss why it's wrong
3. Document the lesson learned
4. Fix it together

### "What about Claude hallucinations?"

Our workflow prevents this:

- Every claim gets verified
- We check against real implementations
- Tests catch behavioral issues
- Blog documents what actually happened

## Try Our Workflow Yourself

<Aside type="note">Want to build something with AI assistance? Here's our template:</Aside>

1. **Start Small**: "Build a simple key-value store"
2. **Ask Why**: "Why use a hash map here?"
3. **Request Options**: "Show me 3 ways to handle collisions"
4. **Test Everything**: "What edge cases should we test?"
5. **Document Learnings**: "What did I learn from this?"
