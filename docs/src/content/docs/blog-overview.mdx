Welcome to the FerrisDB development blog! Follow our unique collaboration as a CRUD developer and
Claude AI build a database from scratch. Experience both perspectives: the human journey of
discovery through questions and review, and the AI analysis of patterns in learning and
collaboration.

## Our Collaboration Experiment

This blog documents a unique experiment in human-AI collaboration for software development. Unlike
typical AI coding assistants that just generate code, we've developed a structured workflow:

<Aside type="tip" title="Our Collaboration Workflow">
  1. **Human assigns task** - "Implement SSTable compaction" 2. **Claude implements with
  explanations** - Working code plus the reasoning 3. **Human reviews and questions** - "Why this
  approach? What about edge cases?" 4. **Both iterate until understood** - Multiple cycles until the
  human truly gets it
