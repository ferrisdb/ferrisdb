## Day 2: SSTable Implementation, Optimization, and Architectural Refinement

Welcome back to the FerrisDB development journey! Day 2 was packed with technical achievements, starting with implementing the core SSTable functionality and culminating in significant optimizations and architectural improvements. Let's dive into the technical achievements and design decisions that shaped today's work.

## üéØ Day 2 Achievements

### 1. SSTable Format Design and Implementation

**Challenge**: Design a robust, efficient binary format for storing sorted key-value pairs on disk with support for MVCC, fast lookups, and data integrity.

**SSTable Binary Format Specification**:

```rust
// File structure:
// [Data Block 1][Data Block 2]...[Data Block N][Index Block][Footer]
// 
// Each data block contains:
// - Header: block_size(u32), entry_count(u32), checksum(u32)
// - Entries: sorted by InternalKey
// - Each entry: key_len(u32), key_data, value_len(u32), value_data, operation(u8)
```

**Key Design Decisions**:

- **4KB block size**: Balances memory usage with I/O efficiency
- **CRC32 checksums**: Per-block integrity verification
- **Index block**: Maps first key of each block for fast lookups
- **Little-endian encoding**: Consistent cross-platform compatibility

### 2. SSTable Writer Implementation

**Features Implemented**:

```rust
pub struct SSTableWriter {
    file: File,
    current_block: Vec<SSTableEntry>,
    index: Vec<IndexEntry>,
    options: SSTableOptions,
}

impl SSTableWriter {
    pub fn add(&mut self, key: InternalKey, value: Value, operation: Operation) -> Result<()> {
        // Maintains sort order, flushes blocks at 4KB
        // Builds index incrementally
    }
    
    pub fn finish(mut self) -> Result<()> {
        // Writes final block, index, and footer
        // Ensures all data is synced to disk
    }
}
```

**Implementation Highlights**:

- Streaming writes with automatic block flushing
- Incremental index building during write
- Atomic file operations for crash safety
- Comprehensive error handling for I/O failures

### 3. SSTable Reader with Initial Implementation

After implementing the writer, we built the reader with a straightforward approach that revealed optimization opportunities.

### 4. SSTable Reader Optimization with Binary Search

**Challenge**: Our initial SSTable reader used linear search within data blocks, which becomes inefficient as block sizes grow.

**Solution**: Implemented binary search optimization leveraging InternalKey ordering:

```rust
// Before: O(n) linear search
for entry in entries {
    if entry.key == target_key {
        return Some(entry.value);
    }
}

// After: O(log n) binary search
match entries.binary_search_by(|entry| entry.key.cmp(&target_key)) {
    Ok(index) => Ok(Some(entries[index].value.clone())),
    Err(_) => Ok(None)
}
```

**Impact**: Dramatically improved lookup performance for large blocks, aligning with industry standards used by RocksDB and LevelDB.

### 5. API Usability Improvements

**Problem**: The original SSTable reader API required specifying an `Operation` when reading, even though operation is metadata, not part of key identity.

**Before**:

```rust
// Awkward: why do I need Operation::Put to read?
reader.get(&InternalKey::new(key, ts, Operation::Put))?
```

**After**:

```rust
// Clean: just specify the key and timestamp
reader.get(&key, timestamp)?
```

**Benefits**: More intuitive API that separates concerns between key identity and storage metadata.

### 6. Major Architectural Refactor: Operation Separation

**Core Insight**: After implementing the reader, we realized that `Operation` shouldn't be part of `InternalKey`. Operations are storage metadata, not key identity.

**Architectural Changes**:

- **InternalKey**: Now only contains `(user_key, timestamp)` for MVCC ordering
- **SSTableEntry**: Added `operation` field for storage metadata
- **Binary Format**: Updated to store operation with each entry
- **APIs**: Writer now accepts operation as separate parameter

**Before**:

```rust
pub struct InternalKey {
    pub user_key: Key,
    pub timestamp: Timestamp,
    pub operation: Operation,  // ‚ùå Mixing concerns
}

writer.add(internal_key, value)?;
```

**After**:

```rust
pub struct InternalKey {
    pub user_key: Key,
    pub timestamp: Timestamp,  // ‚úÖ Pure key identity
}

pub struct SSTableEntry {
    pub key: InternalKey,
    pub value: Value,
    pub operation: Operation,  // ‚úÖ Storage metadata
}

writer.add(key, value, operation)?;
```

## üîß Technical Deep Dive

### SSTable Architecture

Our SSTable implementation follows industry best practices while adding FerrisDB-specific optimizations:

**Block-Based Structure**:

- **Data blocks**: 4KB chunks containing sorted entries
- **Index block**: First key of each data block for fast navigation
- **Footer**: Metadata including index location and magic number

**Two-Level Lookup Process**:

1. Binary search in index to find target data block
2. Load only the required block into memory
3. Binary search within block for target key

This design minimizes I/O by reading only necessary blocks rather than scanning entire files.

### Binary Search Implementation

The optimization leverages our InternalKey ordering invariant:

- Primary sort: `user_key` (ascending)
- Secondary sort: `timestamp` (descending - newer first)

This ordering enables efficient MVCC operations while supporting fast exact-match lookups.

### InternalKey Ordering Logic

```rust
impl Ord for InternalKey {
    fn cmp(&self, other: &Self) -> std::cmp::Ordering {
        match self.user_key.cmp(&other.user_key) {
            Ordering::Equal => {
                // Newer timestamps come first (descending order)
                other.timestamp.cmp(&self.timestamp)
            }
            other => other,
        }
    }
}
```

### Two-Level Search Strategy

1. **Index Level**: Binary search through block index to find target block
2. **Block Level**: Binary search within block entries for exact match

This provides `O(log B + log E)` complexity where B = blocks, E = entries per block.

## üìä Performance Impact

### Implementation Achievements

## üîÑ Development Process Insights

### Iterative Refinement Philosophy

Day 2 demonstrated the value of iterative development:

1. **Design** robust data structures (SSTable format specification)
2. **Implement** core functionality (SSTable writer and reader)
3. **Identify** inefficiencies (linear search in reader)
4. **Optimize** with proven algorithms (binary search)
5. **Reflect** on design decisions (Operation placement)
6. **Refactor** for architectural clarity and better APIs

### Human-AI Collaboration Highlights

The architectural refactor emerged from collaborative discussion:

- **Human insight**: "Should Operation be part of InternalKey?"
- **AI analysis**: Evaluated pros/cons, implementation complexity
- **Joint decision**: Separated concerns for better semantics
- **Systematic execution**: Step-by-step refactoring with full test coverage

## üöÄ Looking Ahead to Day 3
