# Content Guidelines

Guidelines for creating educational and engaging content for the FerrisDB project.

## Content Types

### [Blogging Guidelines](blogging.md)

Guidelines for writing engaging blog posts that document the FerrisDB development journey, including format requirements, statistics gathering, and engagement techniques.

### [Claude's Blog Voice](claude-blog-voice.md)

Specific guidelines for Claude's AI perspective blog posts, focusing on pattern recognition, collaboration analysis, and meta-observations about human-AI development.

### [Deep Dive Articles](deep-dive-articles.md)

Comprehensive technical articles that explain database concepts through FerrisDB's implementation. These serve as authoritative references for understanding database internals.

### [Rust by Example](rust-by-example.md)

Educational articles teaching Rust concepts through real FerrisDB code, with comparisons to JavaScript, Python, Java, and Go to help CRUD developers learn Rust.

### [Website Design](website-design.md)

Design guidelines for the FerrisDB documentation website, covering visual design, content structure, Jekyll configuration, and user experience principles.

## Key Principles

### Educational First

Every piece of content should help readers learn and understand database systems better.

### Honest and Transparent

- Show real progress, including failures and learning moments
- Accurately represent human vs AI contributions
- Don't claim features or performance that doesn't exist

### Engaging and Accessible

- Write for CRUD developers, not just systems programmers
- Use relatable analogies and examples
- Create a "page-turner" experience with personality

### Technically Accurate

- Use actual FerrisDB code, not toy examples
- Verify all performance claims with real measurements
- Test all code examples before publishing

## Content Creation Workflow

1. **Choose appropriate content type** based on your goal
2. **Use the provided template** for consistency
3. **Write with the target audience in mind**
4. **Include real code and measurements**
5. **Format with prettier** and **lint with markdownlint**
