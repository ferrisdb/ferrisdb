# Website Design Guidelines

Design guidelines for the FerrisDB documentation website, focusing on educational value and user engagement.

## Design Philosophy

- **Educational First**: Every design decision should make learning easier
- **Page-Turner Experience**: Content should be engaging and flow naturally
- **Transparent & Honest**: Show real progress, real mistakes, real learning
- **Human-AI Balance**: Showcase collaboration without overselling either side

## Visual Design

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Use ONLY Just the Docs built-in utilities. No custom CSS allowed.

### Color Palette

Defined in `_sass/color_schemes/ferrisdb.scss` and applied automatically:

- **Primary**: Rust orange - use `.btn-primary` or `.text-purple-300`
- **Text**: High contrast dark gray - default text color
- **Backgrounds**: Use `.bg-grey-lt-000` for light sections

### Typography

Use Just the Docs utility classes:

- **Font Size**: `.fs-1` to `.fs-10` (9px to 48px)
- **Font Weight**: `.fw-300`, `.fw-400`, `.fw-500`, `.fw-700`
- **Small Text**: `.text-small` for meta information

### Layout

- **Spacing**: Use `.mb-*`, `.mt-*`, `.my-*` classes (1-8 scale)
- **Alignment**: Use `.text-center`, `.text-left`, `.text-right`
- **No custom containers**: Let Just the Docs handle max-width

## Content Structure

### Homepage Flow

1. **Hero with clear value proposition**
2. **Learning paths for different audiences**
3. **Why we built this (emotional connection)**
4. **What you'll learn (concrete benefits)**
5. **Progress tracking (transparency)**
6. **AI collaboration showcase**
7. **Educational resources**
8. **Call to action**

### Navigation

## ROADMAP.md as Source of Truth

The `ROADMAP.md` file is the SINGLE source of truth for ALL project progress displayed on the website. Never add progress information that isn't tracked in ROADMAP.md.

**ROADMAP.md Structure**:

- **Storage Engine Foundation**: Core database components (WAL, MemTable, SSTable, etc.)
- **Basic Operations**: CRUD operations and queries
- **ACID Transactions**: Transaction support and MVCC
- **Distribution Layer**: Distributed system features
- **Performance & Monitoring**: Metrics and benchmarking
- **Operations & Management**: Admin tools and utilities
- **Client & API**: Protocol and client libraries
- **Production Readiness**: Reliability features
- **Documentation & Examples**: Docs and learning materials
- **Educational Content**: Tutorials and guides

**Mapping ROADMAP.md to Website Content**:

1. ‚úÖ Items marked `[x]` ‚Üí "Available Now" / "What's Working" / "Core Concepts (Available Now)"
2. üöß Items marked `[ ]` in current focus areas ‚Üí "Currently Building" / "In Progress"
3. ‚è≥ Items in later sections ‚Üí "Coming Soon" / "Coming Next"

**ALL Progress Sections Must Update from ROADMAP.md**:

- `/index.md` ‚Üí "Latest Progress" section (lines 102-124) and "Development Progress" table (lines 97-108)
- `/start-here.md` ‚Üí "What You'll Learn" section (lines 32-50) and "What's implemented so far" section (lines 68-74)
- Any other page showing feature status

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

### Daily/Weekly Updates

- [ ] Update progress stats on homepage and start-here page:
  - Days: `git log --format="%ad" --date=short -- "*.rs" "Cargo.toml" | sort | uniq | wc -l`
  - Lines of Rust code: `find . -path ./target -prune -o -name "*.rs" -type f -print | xargs wc -l | tail -1`
  - Test count: `grep -r "#\[test\]" --include="*.rs" . | wc -l`
  - Rust commits: `git log --oneline -- "*.rs" "Cargo.toml" "Cargo.lock" | wc -l`

### Update ALL Progress Sections from ROADMAP.md

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: ALL progress information on the website MUST be derived from ROADMAP.md. Never add features that aren't tracked there.

#### 1. Update `/start-here.md` Progress Sections

**"What You'll Learn" section (lines 32-50)**

1. Check ROADMAP.md for completed/in-progress items
2. Update three subsections:
   - **Core Concepts (Available Now)**: Completed items from "Storage Engine Foundation"
   - **Currently Building**: In-progress items from current focus areas
   - **Coming Soon**: Items from later ROADMAP.md sections
3. Transform technical terms into learner-friendly language:
   - "Write-Ahead Log (WAL)" ‚Üí "Why databases need Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) for crash recovery"
   - "MemTable (Skip List)" ‚Üí "How databases store data in memory with Skip Lists"
   - "SSTable format" ‚Üí "The SSTable format - how databases organize data on disk"
   - "Compaction" ‚Üí "Compaction - how databases merge files efficiently"
   - "Bloom filters" ‚Üí "Bloom filters - probabilistic data structures for speed"

**"What's implemented so far" section (lines 68-74)**

1. List completed items from ROADMAP.md with checkmarks
2. Show current work in progress
3. Mention what's coming next (interactive REPL when "CLI client" is ready)

#### 2. Update `/index.md` Progress Sections

**"Development Progress" table (lines 97-108)**:

1. Check ROADMAP.md for completed/in-progress items
2. Update table rows:
   - ‚úÖ Mark completed sections as "Complete"
   - üöß Mark sections with active work as "In Progress"
   - ‚è≥ Mark future sections as "Planned"
3. Include brief technical descriptions for each component

**"Latest Progress" section (if exists)**:

1. Check ROADMAP.md for completed/in-progress items
2. Update three subsections:
   - **‚úÖ What's Working**: All items marked `[x]` in ROADMAP.md
   - **üöß Currently Building**: Items marked `[ ]` in current focus areas (usually Storage Engine)
   - **‚è≥ Coming Next**: Next logical items from ROADMAP.md
3. Use technical descriptions (more detailed than start-here.md):
   - Include implementation details: "MemTable with concurrent Skip List"
   - Mention optimizations: "SSTable reader with binary search optimization"
   - Reference architectural decisions: "Clean API design after Day 2 refactoring"

#### 3. Check for Other Progress Sections

- Search for any other pages mentioning features or progress
- Ensure they all reference ROADMAP.md items only
- Update as needed to maintain consistency

### Language Guidelines for Progress Updates

**For `/start-here.md` (learner-focused)**

- Use "why" and "how" framing
- Explain the purpose of each feature
- Make it accessible to CRUD developers
- Example: "Why databases need Write-Ahead Logs" not just "WAL implemented"

**For `/index.md` (technically accurate)**

- Use precise technical terms
- Include implementation details
- Mention specific algorithms or data structures
- Example: "MemTable with concurrent Skip List" not just "in-memory storage"

### Daily Homepage Checklist

- [ ] **Development Progress table** (lines 101-108): Reflects current ROADMAP.md status
- [ ] **Latest Collaboration Metrics** (lines 127-133): Update from actual collaboration data
  - Pattern recognitions: Count Claude's insights in recent blog posts
  - Human intuition saves: Times human review prevented issues
  - Collaboration score: Subjective assessment of recent work quality
  - Tests passing: `grep -r "#\[test\]" --include="*.rs" . | wc -l`
- [ ] **Educational Resources** (lines 134-157): Keep links current and mark "Coming Soon" items
  - Update database concepts article links to real URLs
  - Mark new articles as available vs "Coming Soon"
  - Update Rust by Example progress
- [ ] **No production claims**: Keep messaging as educational/experimental
- [ ] **CTA buttons work**: All links go to existing pages

### Per Blog Post

- [ ] Ensure title follows compelling hook pattern
- [ ] Update permalink to match title
- [ ] Check companion post links work
- [ ] Verify code examples match actual implementation

### When New Features Are Ready

- [ ] **When Binary/REPL is Available**: Update "Try It Now" sections
  - Homepage: Replace "See The Code In Action" with actual REPL example
  - Start-here: Add interactive playground example
  - Example format:

    ```bash
    # Docker example (when available)
    docker run -it ferrisdb/playground

    ferris> set key "value"
    OK
    ferris> get key
    "value"
    ```

- [ ] **When Server is Ready**: Add client connection examples

### Weekly Link & Content Validation

- [ ] **Test all CTAs on homepage**: Ensure buttons go to existing pages
- [ ] **Validate learning paths**: Check that all "Start Learning" ‚Üí "Database Concepts" ‚Üí "Rust by Example" flows work
- [ ] **Check blog cross-references**: Verify companion post links between human/Claude blogs
- [ ] **Validate external links**: GitHub repo, issues, discussions links still work
- [ ] **Content accuracy check**: All technical claims match actual ROADMAP.md progress
