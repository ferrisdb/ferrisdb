# Website Design Guidelines

Design guidelines for the FerrisDB documentation website, focusing on educational value and user engagement.

## Design Philosophy

- **Educational First**: Every design decision should make learning easier
- **Page-Turner Experience**: Content should be engaging and flow naturally
- **Transparent & Honest**: Show real progress, real mistakes, real learning
- **Human-AI Balance**: Showcase collaboration without overselling either side

## Visual Design

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Use ONLY Just the Docs built-in utilities. No custom CSS allowed.

### Color Palette

Defined in `_sass/color_schemes/ferrisdb.scss` and applied automatically:

- **Primary**: Rust orange - use `.btn-primary` or `.text-purple-300`
- **Text**: High contrast dark gray - default text color
- **Backgrounds**: Use `.bg-grey-lt-000` for light sections

### Typography

Use Just the Docs utility classes:

- **Font Size**: `.fs-1` to `.fs-10` (9px to 48px)
- **Font Weight**: `.fw-300`, `.fw-400`, `.fw-500`, `.fw-700`
- **Small Text**: `.text-small` for meta information

### Layout

- **Spacing**: Use `.mb-*`, `.mt-*`, `.my-*` classes (1-8 scale)
- **Alignment**: Use `.text-center`, `.text-left`, `.text-right`
- **No custom containers**: Let Just the Docs handle max-width

## ROADMAP.md as Source of Truth

The `ROADMAP.md` file is the SINGLE source of truth for ALL project progress displayed on the website. Never add progress information that isn't tracked in ROADMAP.md.

**ROADMAP.md Structure**:

- **Storage Engine Foundation**: Core database components (WAL, MemTable, SSTable, etc.)
- **Basic Operations**: CRUD operations and queries
- **ACID Transactions**: Transaction support and MVCC
- **Distribution Layer**: Distributed system features
- **Performance & Monitoring**: Metrics and benchmarking
- **Operations & Management**: Admin tools and utilities
- **Client & API**: Protocol and client libraries
- **Production Readiness**: Reliability features
- **Documentation & Examples**: Docs and learning materials
- **Educational Content**: Tutorials and guides

**Mapping ROADMAP.md to Website Content**:

1. ‚úÖ Items marked `[x]` ‚Üí "Available Now" / "What's Working" / "Core Concepts (Available Now)"
2. üöß Items marked `[ ]` in current focus areas ‚Üí "Currently Building" / "In Progress"
3. ‚è≥ Items in later sections ‚Üí "Coming Soon" / "Coming Next"

**ALL Progress Sections Must Update from ROADMAP.md**:

- `/index.md` ‚Üí "Latest Progress" section (lines 102-124) and "Development Progress" table (lines 97-108)
- `/start-here.md` ‚Üí "What You'll Learn" section (lines 32-50) and "What's implemented so far" section (lines 68-74)
- Any other page showing feature status

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

### Daily/Weekly Updates

- [ ] Update progress stats on homepage and start-here page:
  - Use cached statistics function (see FAQ Maintenance Commands below)
  - Update all pages with consistent stats from same commit
  - Only recomputes if HEAD commit has changed since last cache
- [ ] Update FAQ.md statistics and accuracy (see FAQ Maintenance section below)

### Update ALL Progress Sections from ROADMAP.md

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: ALL progress information on the website MUST be derived from ROADMAP.md. Never add features that aren't tracked there.

#### 1. Update `/start-here.md` Progress Sections

**"What You'll Learn" section (lines 32-50)**

1. Check ROADMAP.md for completed/in-progress items
2. Update three subsections:
   - **Core Concepts (Available Now)**: Completed items from "Storage Engine Foundation"
   - **Currently Building**: In-progress items from current focus areas
   - **Coming Soon**: Items from later ROADMAP.md sections
3. Transform technical terms into learner-friendly language:
   - "Write-Ahead Log (WAL)" ‚Üí "Why databases need Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) for crash recovery"
   - "MemTable (Skip List)" ‚Üí "How databases store data in memory with Skip Lists"
   - "SSTable format" ‚Üí "The SSTable format - how databases organize data on disk"
   - "Compaction" ‚Üí "Compaction - how databases merge files efficiently"
   - "Bloom filters" ‚Üí "Bloom filters - probabilistic data structures for speed"

**"What's implemented so far" section (lines 68-74)**

1. List completed items from ROADMAP.md with checkmarks
2. Show current work in progress
3. Mention what's coming next (interactive REPL when "CLI client" is ready)

#### 2. Update `/index.md` Progress Sections

**"Development Progress" table (lines 97-108)**:

1. Check ROADMAP.md for completed/in-progress items
2. Update table rows:
   - ‚úÖ Mark completed sections as "Complete"
   - üöß Mark sections with active work as "In Progress"
   - ‚è≥ Mark future sections as "Planned"
3. Include brief technical descriptions for each component

**"Latest Progress" section (if exists)**:

1. Check ROADMAP.md for completed/in-progress items
2. Update three subsections:
   - **‚úÖ What's Working**: All items marked `[x]` in ROADMAP.md
   - **üöß Currently Building**: Items marked `[ ]` in current focus areas (usually Storage Engine)
   - **‚è≥ Coming Next**: Next logical items from ROADMAP.md
3. Use technical descriptions (more detailed than start-here.md):
   - Include implementation details: "MemTable with concurrent Skip List"
   - Mention optimizations: "SSTable reader with binary search optimization"
   - Reference architectural decisions: "Clean API design after Day 2 refactoring"

#### 3. Check for Other Progress Sections

- Search for any other pages mentioning features or progress
- Ensure they all reference ROADMAP.md items only
- Update as needed to maintain consistency

### Language Guidelines for Progress Updates

**For `/start-here.md` (learner-focused)**

- Use "why" and "how" framing
- Explain the purpose of each feature
- Make it accessible to CRUD developers
- Example: "Why databases need Write-Ahead Logs" not just "WAL implemented"

**For `/index.md` (technically accurate)**

- Use precise technical terms
- Include implementation details
- Mention specific algorithms or data structures
- Example: "MemTable with concurrent Skip List" not just "in-memory storage"

**Commands for FAQ Maintenance:**

```bash
# Cached statistics script (avoids recomputing for same commit)
get_cached_stats() {
    local current_commit=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
    local cache_file="/tmp/ferrisdb_stats_cache.txt"

    # Check if cache exists and matches current commit
    if [[ -f "$cache_file" ]]; then
        local cached_commit=$(head -n1 "$cache_file" 2>/dev/null)
        if [[ "$cached_commit" == "$current_commit" ]]; then
            # Use cached stats
            tail -n+2 "$cache_file"
            return 0
        fi
    fi

    # Compute fresh stats and cache them
    echo "Computing fresh statistics for commit $current_commit..."
    local days=$(git log --format="%ad" --date=short -- "*.rs" "Cargo.toml" | sort | uniq | wc -l)
    local lines=$(find . -path ./target -prune -o -name "*.rs" -type f -print | xargs wc -l | tail -1 | awk '{print $1}')
    local tests=$(grep -r "#\[test\]" --include="*.rs" . | wc -l)
    local posts=$(find docs/_posts -name "*.md" | grep -v template | wc -l)

    # Cache results
    {
        echo "$current_commit"
        echo "DAYS=$days"
        echo "LINES=$lines"
        echo "TESTS=$tests"
        echo "POSTS=$posts"
        echo "SUMMARY=\"Day $days of development with $lines lines of Rust code, $tests passing tests, and $posts blog posts\""
    } > "$cache_file"

    # Output the stats
    tail -n+2 "$cache_file"
}

# Usage Examples:

# 1. Get the summary string directly
SUMMARY=$(get_cached_stats | grep "SUMMARY=" | cut -d= -f2- | tr -d '"')
echo "$SUMMARY"

# 2. Source all stats as variables
eval "$(get_cached_stats)"
echo "Days: $DAYS, Lines: $LINES, Tests: $TESTS, Posts: $POSTS"

# 3. Get individual values
DAYS_COUNT=$(get_cached_stats | grep "DAYS=" | cut -d= -f2)
LINES_COUNT=$(get_cached_stats | grep "LINES=" | cut -d= -f2)

# Benefits:
# - First call computes and caches (takes ~2-3 seconds)
# - Subsequent calls use cache (instant, <0.1 seconds)
# - Cache invalidates automatically when HEAD commit changes
# - Perfect for maintenance sessions updating multiple pages
