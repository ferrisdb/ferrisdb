- [Common Commands](workflow/commands.md) - Frequently used commands
- [Git Workflow](workflow/git-workflow.md) - Branching and commit standards
- [PR Process](workflow/pr-process.md) - Pull request and review policies

### üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

- [Architecture Decisions](technical/architecture.md) - Key design choices
- [Storage Engine](technical/storage-engine.md) - Storage implementation guidelines
- [Performance](technical/performance.md) - Optimization and benchmarking
- [Security](technical/security.md) - Security best practices
- [System Invariants](technical/invariants.md) - Critical system properties

## Getting Started

1. **New Contributors**: Start with [Code Style](development/code-style.md) and [Git Workflow](workflow/git-workflow.md)
2. **Content Writers**: Review [Blogging Guidelines](content/blogging.md) or relevant article formats
3. **Core Developers**: Familiarize yourself with [Architecture Decisions](technical/architecture.md) and [System Invariants](technical/invariants.md)

## Our Human-AI Workflow

FerrisDB demonstrates a specific collaboration pattern:

1. **Human assigns task**: Clear direction with context
2. **Claude implements**: Complete solution with tests
3. **Human reviews**: Questions, optimization ideas, edge cases
4. **Claude iterates**: Improvements based on feedback
5. **Together refine**: Until both are satisfied
6. **PR & merge**: Clear commits and documentation

This workflow is documented honestly in our blog posts, showing real conversations and actual development progress.

## Project Overview

FerrisDB is a distributed, transactional key-value database inspired by FoundationDB, implemented in Rust. This project serves as both a learning exercise and a demonstration of human-AI collaboration in software development.

## Key Principles

1. **Educational First**: Every decision should make learning easier
2. **Accuracy Always**: Verify technical details against codebase and git history
3. **Transparency**: Document real progress, real mistakes, real learning
4. **Quality Code**: Follow Rust best practices and idioms
5. **Real Collaboration**: Show actual human-AI workflow, not idealized version
6. **Documentation**: Keep everything well-documented and accessible
