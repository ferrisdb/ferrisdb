## Project Overview

FerrisDB is a distributed, transactional key-value database inspired by FoundationDB, implemented in Rust. This project serves as both a learning exercise and a demonstration of human-AI collaboration in software development.

## Key Principles

1. **Educational First**: Every decision should make learning easier
2. **Transparency**: Document real progress, real mistakes, real learning
3. **Quality Code**: Follow Rust best practices and idioms
4. **Collaboration**: Showcase effective human-AI partnership
5. **Documentation**: Keep everything well-documented and accessible
