## Why We Built This

**Have you ever wondered how databases really work? We did too.**
{: .fs-5 .fw-500 }

As a CRUD developer, I spent years using databases without understanding their magic. Then I partnered with Claude, an AI assistant, to build one from scratch. Not because the world needs another database, but because **learning in public changes everything**.

This project proves three things:

üí° **Complex systems can be understood** - with the right explanations

ü§ù **AI amplifies human potential** - it doesn't replace developers

üìñ **Learning together is better** - every mistake becomes a lesson

> "Working with Claude showed me that AI isn't here to take our jobs - it's here to help us tackle projects we never thought possible."

> ‚Äî The Human Developer
