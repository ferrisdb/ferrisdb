This page documents interesting architectural patterns and advanced concepts we might explore as FerrisDB evolves from an educational project toward production-ready capabilities.

## üîÑ Separation of Storage and Compute

**Concept:** Completely decouple storage nodes from compute nodes for independent scaling and cost optimization.

- **Storage layer:** Pure data persistence (database-aware object storage)
- **Compute layer:** Query processing, transactions, caching
- **Benefits:** Independent scaling, cost optimization, multi-tenant isolation
- **Examples:** Snowflake, Amazon Aurora, CockroachDB Serverless

**Learning value:** Understanding modern cloud-native database architecture patterns.

## üåê Shared-Nothing vs Shared-Storage

**Current approach:** Shared-nothing (each node owns data shards)  
**Alternative exploration:** Shared-storage (all nodes access common storage pool)

- Multiple compute nodes can read/write same data
- Enables instant failover and load balancing
- Storage becomes the single source of truth
- Trade-offs in consistency, performance, and complexity

## üìù Log-Structured Everything

**Beyond LSM-trees:** Make the entire system log-based for maximum consistency and auditability.

- **Log as database:** All operations are immutable log entries
- **Materialized views:** Derive tables and indexes from the log
- **Time travel:** Query any point in history naturally
- **Benefits:** Perfect audit trail, simplified backup/restore, event sourcing

**Research areas:**

- Log compaction strategies
- Efficient materialized view maintenance
- Query optimization over log structures

## üìä HTAP (Hybrid Transactional/Analytical)

**Goal:** Single system handles both OLTP and OLAP workloads efficiently.

- **Columnar storage:** For analytical queries
- **Row storage:** For transactional workloads
- **Automatic routing:** Query optimizer chooses optimal storage format
- **Real-time analytics:** Fresh data available immediately

**Implementation approaches:**

- Dual storage formats with synchronization
- Adaptive storage layouts based on access patterns
- Vectorized execution for analytical queries

## üéØ Multi-Model Architecture

**Progressive approach:** Support multiple data models while learning optimal integration patterns.

### Phase 1: Layered Implementation

```
Document API  ‚Üí  LSM Storage Engine
Graph API     ‚Üí  LSM Storage Engine
TimeSeries    ‚Üí  LSM Storage Engine
```

### Phase 2: Hybrid Integration

- Native JSON document support in storage format
- Specialized indexing for different models
- Cross-model query capabilities

### Phase 3: Unified Multi-Model

- Storage engine natively understands multiple data types
- Atomic transactions across all models
- Optimized storage layouts per data type

**Models to explore:**

- **Document store:** JSON/BSON with rich querying
- **Graph database:** Relationships and graph traversals
- **Time series:** Optimized for metrics and IoT data
- **Search engine:** Full-text search and indexing

## üöÄ Consensus-Free Coordination

**Beyond Raft:** Explore alternative coordination mechanisms for better performance.

- **CRDTs:** Conflict-free replicated data types for eventual consistency
- **Calvin-style:** Deterministic transaction scheduling
- **Clock synchronization:** Spanner-style global ordering
- **Hybrid approaches:** Combine techniques based on workload characteristics

## üåä Streaming Architecture

**Real-time data processing:** Built-in stream processing capabilities.

- **Change streams:** Real-time data change notifications
- **Materialized views:** Continuously updated query results
- **Event sourcing:** Store events, compute state on demand
- **Stream integration:** Native Kafka/Pulsar compatibility

**Use cases:**

- Real-time analytics and dashboards
- Event-driven microservices integration
- Live data synchronization between systems

## üåç Multi-Region/Multi-Cloud

**Global distribution:** Advanced topology management for worldwide deployments.

- **Region-aware partitioning:** Data gravity and compliance requirements
- **Cross-region transactions:** Global consistency with performance optimization
- **Cloud portability:** Seamless operation across AWS/GCP/Azure
- **Edge caching:** Bringing data closer to users

**Challenges to explore:**

- Network partition handling
- Latency-aware query routing
- Compliance and data sovereignty
- Cost optimization across regions

## üß† Adaptive/Self-Tuning Systems

**Machine learning integration:** Systems that optimize themselves based on workload patterns.

- **Auto-compaction:** ML-driven compaction strategies
- **Query optimization:** Learn from historical query patterns
- **Resource allocation:** Dynamic memory/CPU allocation
- **Anomaly detection:** Automatic performance issue detection

**Research areas:**

- Reinforcement learning for database tuning
- Workload prediction and preparation
- Automated schema optimization
- Performance regression detection

## ‚ö° Serverless Database

**Pay-per-query model:** True serverless database with instant scaling.

- **Instant startup:** Cold start in milliseconds
- **Auto-scaling:** Scale to zero, scale to millions of requests
- **Function integration:** Native serverless function support
- **Cost model:** Pay only for storage and actual compute used

**Technical challenges:**

- Warm/cold state management
- Connection pooling and management
- Resource scheduling and allocation
- Billing and metering accuracy
