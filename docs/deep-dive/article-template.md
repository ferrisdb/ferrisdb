DEEP DIVE ARTICLE TEMPLATE

This template ensures consistency across all deep dive technical articles.
Deep dives are comprehensive, technical articles that thoroughly explain
database concepts through FerrisDB's implementation.

TARGET AUDIENCE: CRUD developers who want to understand database internals deeply
                 (assume basic programming knowledge but NOT systems programming background)
GOAL: Make complex database concepts accessible while maintaining technical depth
-->

## The Problem & Why It Matters

<!--
Start with the fundamental problem this concept solves.
Explain WHY this matters for someone building web applications.
Use analogies from everyday experiences (restaurants, filing, traffic, etc).
Connect to problems CRUD developers actually face (slow queries, crashes, data loss).
-->

[Explain the fundamental database problem this concept addresses]
