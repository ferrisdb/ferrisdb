## About FerrisDB

### What is FerrisDB?

FerrisDB is an educational distributed database project built in Rust. It's inspired by FoundationDB
and implements a real LSM-tree based storage engine, WAL for durability, and eventually will include
distributed consensus. The key difference? We're building it completely in public, documenting every
decision, mistake, and learning moment.

**Current Progress**: <Stats />

### Is FerrisDB production-ready?

<Aside type="danger">
  **No!** FerrisDB is explicitly an educational project. While we're building real database
  components that work, this is not intended for production use. Think of it as a fully functional
  teaching tool - it works, but it's optimized for learning, not for your production workload.
</Aside>

### Why build another database?

We're not trying to compete with PostgreSQL, MySQL, or any production database. FerrisDB exists to:

- Demystify how databases actually work
- Show that complex systems can be understood by anyone
- Demonstrate effective human-AI collaboration
- Provide the most transparent database development process ever attempted

### What makes FerrisDB different?

## The Human-AI Collaboration

### Who is building FerrisDB?

FerrisDB is being built by:

- **The Human**: A CRUD developer who spent years using databases without understanding them
- **Claude**: An AI assistant providing knowledge, implementation help, and pattern recognition
- **The Community**: Contributors who help improve code, documentation, and learning materials

### What's Claude's role exactly?

Claude serves multiple roles:

- **Knowledge base**: Explains complex database concepts in understandable terms
- **Implementation partner**: Helps write actual Rust code and debug issues
- **Pattern recognizer**: Identifies common mistakes and learning opportunities
- **Documentation assistant**: Helps create clear, comprehensive documentation
- **Teaching assistant**: Breaks down complex topics for the blog and database concepts articles

### Does AI replace human developers?

Absolutely not! This project proves the opposite. The human provides:

- Creative vision and project direction
- Domain context and real-world experience
- Decision-making about what to build
- Quality control and code review
- The "why" behind features

Claude amplifies human capabilities but can't replace human judgment, creativity, or domain
expertise.

### How do you handle attribution?

We're meticulous about attribution:

- Both blogs document who contributed what
- Git commits include collaboration commentary tracking our process
- We never swap credit for dramatic effect
- Accurate attribution helps study effective collaboration patterns
- All commits include ðŸ¤– emoji to mark AI collaboration

## Learning with FerrisDB

### Who is the target audience?

FerrisDB is perfect for:

- **CRUD developers** curious about database internals
- **Rust learners** who want real-world examples
- **Students** studying database systems
- **Anyone** who's wondered "but how does it actually work?"

### Do I need to know Rust?

Not necessarily! We offer multiple learning paths:

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Database Concepts" icon="magnifier">
    Focus on database concepts (language-agnostic)
  </Card>

<Card title="Rust by Example" icon="seti:rust">
  Learn Rust through database code with comparisons to JavaScript, Python, Java, and Go
</Card>

  <Card title="Development Blog" icon="document">
    Follow our collaboration journey from both human and AI perspectives
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### How should I use FerrisDB to learn?

1. **Start with [Database Concepts](/concepts/database-internals/)** if you want to understand
   database concepts
2. **Try [Rust by Example](/concepts/rust-patterns/)** if you want to learn Rust through practical
   code
3. **Follow the blogs** to understand the development process:
   - **[Main Blog](/blog/)**: Combined view of both perspectives
   - **[Human Perspective](/blog/?author=human)**: Learning journey and code reviews
   - **[AI Perspective](/blog/?author=claude)**: Pattern analysis and collaboration insights
4. **Run the code locally** to experiment and learn by doing
5. **Contribute** to really solidify your understanding

### What will I learn?

**Database concepts:**

- How LSM-trees provide fast writes
- Why Write-Ahead Logs ensure durability
- How SSTables organize data on disk
- Lock-free data structures for concurrency
- MVCC for transaction isolation
- Distributed consensus (coming soon)

**Rust concepts:**

- Ownership and borrowing in practice
- Safe concurrency patterns
- Error handling without exceptions
- Zero-cost abstractions
- Systems programming techniques

## Technical Questions

### Why Rust?

Rust is perfect for databases because:

- **Memory safety** without garbage collection
- **Concurrency** without data races
- **Performance** comparable to C/C++
- **Modern tooling** and ecosystem
- **Learning opportunity** for the human developer

### Why not fork an existing database?

Starting from scratch means:

- Every line of code is understood and documented
- No legacy decisions to work around
- Clear learning progression from simple to complex
- Better teaching opportunity

### What's the architecture?

FerrisDB follows a layered architecture inspired by FoundationDB:

- **Storage Engine**: LSM-tree with MemTable (Skip List) and SSTables âœ…
- **Write-Ahead Log**: Crash recovery and durability âœ…
- **Transaction Layer**: MVCC for isolation (planned)
- **Distribution Layer**: Consensus and sharding (planned)
- **Client Library**: Simple key-value API (planned)

### How can I run it?

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ferrisdb/ferrisdb
cd ferrisdb

# Run tests
cargo test --all

# Run benchmarks
cargo bench

# Build the project
cargo build --release
```

See our [Getting Started guide](/getting-started/) for detailed instructions.

## Contributing and Community

### Can I contribute?

Yes! We welcome contributions:

- **Code improvements**: Performance, safety, clarity
- **Documentation**: Explanations, examples, corrections
- **Bug reports**: Help us improve
- **Feature ideas**: What should we build next?
- **Learning materials**: Tutorials, exercises, examples

### How do I contribute?

1. Read our
   [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/ferrisdb/ferrisdb/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md)
2. Check existing issues or create new ones
3. Fork, branch, implement, test
4. Submit a PR with clear description
5. Iterate based on feedback

### Where can I ask questions?

- **GitHub Issues**: For bugs and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: For questions and community chat
- **Blog comments**: For specific article discussions

### Is there a roadmap?

Yes! Check our [Roadmap](/project/roadmap/) for the current status. We update it regularly as we
progress.

## The Future

### What's next for FerrisDB?

Based on our roadmap, immediate priorities:

1. **Basic Operations**: Get/Put/Delete operations, batch writes, range queries
2. **Storage Optimization**: Compaction, bloom filters, block cache, compression
3. **ACID Transactions**: MVCC foundation, snapshot isolation, optimistic concurrency
4. **Distribution Layer**: Consensus protocols, replication, sharding
5. **Production Features**: Monitoring, backup/restore, client libraries

### Will FerrisDB ever be production-ready?

That's not the goal. FerrisDB succeeds if:

- People understand databases better
- Developers feel empowered to tackle complex projects
- Human-AI collaboration patterns improve
- The community learns together

### How long will development continue?

As long as there's something valuable to learn and teach! We're documenting not just building a
database, but the entire journey of learning systems programming.
