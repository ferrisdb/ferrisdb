  Get it right, then make it fast. Classic engineering wisdom in action.
</Card>

<Card title="🤖 Learning in Public" icon="telescope">
  Real mistakes, real questions, real breakthroughs - nothing hidden from the learning process
</Card>

  <Card title="📚 Fundamentals Focus" icon="open-book">
    Understanding LSM trees, WAL, and SSTables before micro-optimizations
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## See It In Action

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Our Philosophy">
    ```rust
    // Simple, readable, correct
    // Optimize only when you understand the trade-offs
    pub struct LogEntry {
        pub sequence_number: u64,   // Clear naming
        pub key: Vec<u8>,          // Simple types  
        pub value: Option<Vec<u8>>, // Obvious semantics
        pub timestamp: u64,        // No premature optimization
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Real Code">
    ```rust
    // From our actual implementation
    impl MemTable {
        pub fn set(&self, key: Vec<u8>, value: Vec<u8>) -> Result<()> {
            // Simple approach: just insert and track memory
            self.skiplist.insert(key, value);
            self.memory_usage.fetch_add(size, Ordering::Relaxed);
            Ok(())
        }
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  
  <TabItem label="Learning Process">
    ```bash
    # How we actually develop
    git clone https://github.com/ferrisdb/ferrisdb
    
    # Start simple, understand first
    cargo test        # Make sure it works
    cargo run         # See it in action
    # Optimize later when we understand the bottlenecks
    ```

## Learning Progress

<Aside type="note" title="Educational Project">
  FerrisDB is a learning journey, not production software. We prioritize understanding over
  optimization, correctness over speed.
</Aside>

### Current Implementation Status

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="✅ Working & Understood">
    - **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** - Simple binary format, crash recovery works - **MemTable with Skip
    List** - Concurrent, but readable implementation - **Basic SSTable structure** - Straightforward
    serialization format - **Clean API design** - Refactored after learning from mistakes
  </TabItem>

<TabItem label="🚧 Building & Learning">
  - **SSTable reader** - Binary search, keeping it simple - **Compaction strategy** - Basic
  algorithm before optimizations - **Error handling** - Making failures clear and debuggable
</TabItem>

  <TabItem label="⏳ Future Learning">
    - **Bloom filters** - When we understand the read patterns - **Advanced compaction** - After
    mastering the basics - **Distributed features** - Only when single-node is solid - **Performance
    tuning** - Last, when we know what to optimize
  </TabItem>

## The Collaboration Experiment

What happens when a CRUD developer teams up with Claude AI to learn database internals from first
principles?
