<Aside type="tip" title="Not Another Database">
  We're not building a database to compete with PostgreSQL. We're documenting the journey of
  learning how PostgreSQL works by building our own. If you need a database, use PostgreSQL. If you
  want to understand databases, join us!

## The Unique Experiment

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="üë®‚Äçüíª Human Learning" icon="user">
    A CRUD developer with no systems programming experience learning database internals through building
  </Card>

<Card title="ü§ñ AI Teaching" icon="robot">
  Claude AI implementing features and explaining concepts, learning to teach through iteration
</Card>

<Card title="üìñ Public Journey" icon="megaphone">
  Every conversation, every mistake, every "aha!" moment documented in our blog
</Card>

  <Card title="üõ†Ô∏è Real Code" icon="code">
    Actual working implementations, not toy examples - see exactly how databases work
  </Card>

## Current Reality Check

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="What Works Today">
    <Badge text="HONEST STATUS" variant="success" />- ‚úÖ **WAL Implementation** - Crash recovery
    actually works! - ‚úÖ **Concurrent Skip List** - Real lock-free data structure - ‚úÖ **SSTable
    Writer** - Can persist sorted data - ‚úÖ **Blog & Tutorials** - Learn alongside us [See detailed
    status ‚Üí](/status/)
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="What Doesn't Exist">
    <Badge text="NOT BUILT YET" variant="caution" />- ‚ùå **No Server** - Can't run FerrisDB - ‚ùå
    **No Storage Engine** - Components not connected - ‚ùå **No Queries** - Can't get/put data - ‚ùå
    **No Distribution** - Single node only We're building in public - watch it happen!
  </TabItem>
