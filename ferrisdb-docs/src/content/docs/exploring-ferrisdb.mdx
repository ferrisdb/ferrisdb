  FerrisDB is a codebase for learning, not a database you can run. This guide helps you explore the
  implementation and understand how databases work internally.

## Prerequisites

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Rust 1.81+" icon="seti:rust">
    Install via [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
  </Card>

<Card title="Git" icon="github">
  For cloning the repository
</Card>

  <Card title="Curiosity" icon="telescope">
    Desire to understand how databases work
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Getting Started

<Steps>
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ferrisdb/ferrisdb.git
   cd ferrisdb
   ```

2. **Install Rust toolchain**

   ```bash
   rustup toolchain install stable
   rustup component add rustfmt clippy
   ```

3. **Build the components**

   ```bash
   cargo build --all
   ```

4. **Run the tests**
   ```bash
   cargo test --all
   ```
</Steps>

<Aside type="note">
  First build takes a few minutes. You're compiling a (partial) database from scratch!
</Aside>

## Understanding the Code Structure

```text
ferrisdb/
├── ferrisdb-core/       # Basic types (Key, Value, Error)
├── ferrisdb-storage/    # The interesting stuff!
│   ├── src/
│   │   ├── wal/        # Write-ahead log implementation
│   │   ├── memtable/   # Concurrent skip list
│   │   └── sstable/    # File format for persistence
├── ferrisdb-client/     # Stub only
├── ferrisdb-server/     # Stub only
└── ferrisdb-tutorials/  # Hands-on learning
```

## Exploring Key Components

### 1. Write-Ahead Log (WAL)

<Badge text="FULLY IMPLEMENTED" variant="success" />

The WAL ensures durability - data survives crashes:

```bash
# See the implementation
cat ferrisdb-storage/src/wal/writer.rs

# Run WAL-specific tests
cargo test -p ferrisdb-storage wal::

# Trace a write operation
RUST_LOG=debug cargo test test_wal_basic -- --nocapture
```

**What to look for:**

- How entries are encoded in binary format
- CRC32 checksum calculation
- fsync calls for durability

### 2. MemTable (Skip List)

<Badge text="FULLY IMPLEMENTED" variant="success" />

A concurrent skip list for in-memory operations:

```bash
# Explore the skip list
cat ferrisdb-storage/src/memtable/skip_list.rs

# See concurrent operations in action
cargo test -p ferrisdb-storage skiplist::tests::test_concurrent

# Understand MVCC (multi-version concurrency)
grep -n "timestamp" ferrisdb-storage/src/memtable/skip_list.rs
```

**What to look for:**

- Lock-free reading using crossbeam epoch
- How versions are ordered by timestamp
- The clever height selection algorithm

### 3. SSTable Components

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Writer ✅">

<Badge text="IMPLEMENTED" variant="success" />

```bash
# See how data is written to disk
cat ferrisdb-storage/src/sstable/writer.rs

# Test SSTable creation
cargo test -p ferrisdb-storage test_sstable_writer
```

Creates sorted files with index and footer.

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Reader ❌">

<Badge text="NOT IMPLEMENTED" variant="danger" />

```bash
# See the skeleton
cat ferrisdb-storage/src/sstable/reader.rs
```

Structure exists but can't read files yet.

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Learning Exercises

### Exercise 1: Trace a Write

```bash
# Add debug prints to understand flow
echo 'println!("WAL write: {:?}", entry);' >> ferrisdb-storage/src/wal/writer.rs

# Run and see the output
cargo test test_wal_basic -- --nocapture

# Don't forget to remove your prints!
git checkout ferrisdb-storage/src/wal/writer.rs
```

### Exercise 2: Measure Performance

```bash
# Run benchmarks (if any exist)
cargo bench --all

# Time the tests
time cargo test -p ferrisdb-storage

# Check binary size
cargo bloat --release -p ferrisdb-storage
```

### Exercise 3: Find TODOs

```bash
# What's left to implement?
grep -r "TODO" ferrisdb-storage/src/

# What's not implemented?
grep -r "unimplemented!" ferrisdb-storage/src/
```

## Common Patterns to Study

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Error Handling" icon="warning">
    Look for `Result<T>` and `?` operator usage throughout the codebase
  </Card>

<Card title="Concurrency" icon="puzzle">
  See how `Arc`, `Mutex`, and lock-free structures are used
</Card>

<Card title="Binary Encoding" icon="document">
  Understand how data is serialized for disk storage
</Card>

  <Card title="Testing Patterns" icon="checkmark">
    Learn from comprehensive test suites for each component
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Development Tips

### Running Tests Effectively

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --all

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# See println! output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run tests in single thread (for debugging)
RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test

# Use nextest for better output
cargo install cargo-nextest
cargo nextest run --all
```

### Code Exploration Tools

```bash
# Generate and view documentation
cargo doc --all --no-deps --open

# See dependency tree
cargo tree -p ferrisdb-storage

# Find a type definition
grep -r "struct SkipList" ferrisdb-storage/src/
```

## What You Can't Do (Yet)

<Aside type="caution">
  Remember, FerrisDB isn't a working database yet. You cannot: - Start a server - Connect with a
  client - Store and retrieve data - Run benchmarks against a running system
</Aside>
