<Aside type="tip" title="Radical Transparency">
  This page shows exactly what exists in FerrisDB today. We believe in documenting our journey
  honestly - no vaporware, no promises, just reality.
</Aside>

## What FerrisDB Is Today

FerrisDB is an **educational project** where a CRUD developer (human) and an AI (Claude) are learning to build a distributed database from scratch. We're documenting every step of the journey.

**Current state**: We have basic storage components but no usable database yet.

## Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Components

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Write-Ahead Log (WAL)" icon="document">
    - Binary format with CRC32 checksums
    - Configurable sync modes
    - Proper error handling
    - ~500 lines of tested code
  </Card>

<Card title="MemTable (Skip List)" icon="list-format">
  - Concurrent skip list implementation - Lock-free reads, fine-grained write locks - MVCC support
  with timestamps - ~450 lines of tested code
</Card>

  <Card title="SSTable Writer" icon="document">
    - Basic block format defined
    - Can write sorted data to disk
    - Index and footer structures
    - ~650 lines of tested code
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### üöß In Progress

<Card title="SSTable Reader" icon="open-book">
  <Badge text="SKELETON ONLY" variant="caution" />
  Structure defined but not functional. Cannot read SSTables yet.
</Card>

### ‚ùå Not Started

- **Storage Engine Integration** - Components exist separately, not integrated
- **Compaction** - No background merging of SSTables
- **Server** - No network protocol or API
- **Client Library** - No way to connect to a database
- **Transactions** - MVCC timestamps exist but no transaction manager
- **Distribution** - Single-node only, no clustering

## You Can...

### ‚úÖ Today

- Clone and explore the codebase
- Run tests for individual components
- Learn from our blog posts
- Follow our tutorials
- Read our implementation code

### ‚ùå Not Yet

- Run a FerrisDB server
- Store and retrieve data
- Connect with a client
- Deploy to production
- Benchmark performance

## Code Statistics

```bash
# Actual implementation (not counting tests)
ferrisdb-storage/src/: ~1,800 lines
ferrisdb-core/src/: ~200 lines
ferrisdb-client/src/: ~10 lines (stub)
ferrisdb-server/src/: ~5 lines (stub)
```

## Test Coverage

- WAL: 90%+ coverage
- MemTable: 85%+ coverage
- SSTable Writer: 80%+ coverage
- Integration: None (components not integrated)

## What's Next?

We're learning and building in public. Next steps:

1. **Complete SSTable Reader** - Make it actually read files
2. **Integrate Components** - Create basic storage engine
3. **Add Compaction** - Background SSTable merging
4. **Build Server** - Simple key-value API

Follow our [blog](/blog/) to see progress in real-time!

## Try It Yourself

While you can't run FerrisDB as a database yet, you can:

```bash
# Clone and explore
git clone https://github.com/ferrisdb/ferrisdb
cd ferrisdb

# Run component tests
cargo test -p ferrisdb-storage

# Read the implementation
cat ferrisdb-storage/src/wal/writer.rs
```

## The Honest Truth

We're at the beginning of a long journey. FerrisDB today is:

- üìö **Educational** - Great for learning, not for production
- üèóÔ∏è **Incomplete** - Basic components, no full system
- üå± **Growing** - Actively developed, check back often
- ü§ù **Collaborative** - Watch human-AI partnership in action

<Aside type="note">
  Want a production database? Use PostgreSQL or SQLite. Want to learn how databases work by watching
  one being built? You're in the right place!
