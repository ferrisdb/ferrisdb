import { Card, CardGrid, Tabs, TabItem, Aside, Badge } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Aside type="caution" title="Coming Soon">
  Performance benchmarking is planned for after we complete the core functionality. We believe in
  "correctness first, then optimize."
</Aside>

## Our Benchmarking Philosophy

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="üéØ Correctness First" icon="approve-check">
    We won't optimize until we have a working, correct implementation
  </Card>

<Card title="üìä Meaningful Metrics" icon="chart">
  Focus on real-world scenarios, not synthetic benchmarks
</Card>

<Card title="üîç Understanding Bottlenecks" icon="telescope">
  Profile first, then optimize based on actual performance data
</Card>

  <Card title="üìà Learning-Focused" icon="open-book">
    Explain why certain approaches are faster, not just the numbers
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## What We'll Measure

When we reach the benchmarking phase, we'll focus on:

### Core Operations <Badge text="Planned" variant="caution" />

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Write Performance">

    ```rust
    // Operations we'll benchmark:
    
    // Single writes
    db.set(key, value)?;
    
    // Batch writes
    db.batch_write(vec![(key1, value1), (key2, value2)])?;
    
    // Write amplification during compaction
    // (How much extra I/O happens during merges)
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Read Performance">

    ```rust
    // Point lookups
    let value = db.get(key)?;
    
    // Range scans
    for (key, value) in db.scan(start_key..end_key) {
      // Process results
    }
    
    // Read amplification
    // (How many SSTables we need to check)
    ```

  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Memory Usage">

    ```rust
    // MemTable memory efficiency
    let mem_usage = memtable.memory_usage();
    
    // Skip list overhead vs simple HashMap
    let efficiency = data_size / total_memory;
    
    // WAL buffer usage
    let wal_memory = wal.buffer_size();
    ```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Real-World Scenarios

We'll test scenarios that matter for learning:

- **Small dataset (1K-10K records)** - Educational scale
- **Write-heavy workloads** - LSM tree strength
- **Read-heavy workloads** - Where we might struggle
- **Mixed workloads** - Real application patterns

## Benchmarking Methodology

### Our Approach <Badge text="Learning-Focused" variant="note" />

```rust
// Example benchmark structure we'll use
#[bench]
fn bench_memtable_writes(b: &mut Bencher) {
    let memtable = MemTable::new(1024 * 1024); // 1MB limit

    b.iter(|| {
        // Measure what matters for learning
        let start = Instant::now();
        memtable.set(random_key(), random_value());
        let duration = start.elapsed();

        // Track memory usage too
        let memory = memtable.memory_usage();

        // Log interesting patterns for blog posts
        if memory > threshold {
            println!("MemTable approaching flush size");
        }
    });
}
```

### Comparison Baselines

When ready, we'll compare against:

- **HashMap** - Simple baseline for MemTable
- **BTreeMap** - Sorted alternative to Skip List
- **RocksDB** - Production LSM implementation
- **SQLite** - Different storage model

<Aside type="tip" title="Educational Focus">
  Our benchmarks will emphasize understanding WHY certain designs are faster, not just proving
  FerrisDB is fast.
</Aside>

## Performance Predictions

Based on our current design choices:

### Expected Strengths

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Sequential Writes" icon="forward">
    **LSM design optimizes for this** WAL + MemTable should handle sequential writes very
    efficiently
  </Card>

  <Card title="Range Queries" icon="list-format">
    **Skip list maintains sort order** Sorted iteration should be faster than hash-based storage
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

### Expected Challenges

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Random Reads" icon="random">
    **Multiple SSTable checks** Without bloom filters, we might read multiple files per lookup
  </Card>

  <Card title="Memory Overhead" icon="warning">
    **Skip list pointers** More memory per entry than simple HashMap
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## What We'll Learn

Our benchmarking will help answer questions like:

- **How much does WAL impact write performance?**
- **When should MemTable flush to SSTable?**
- **What's the overhead of skip lists vs simpler structures?**
- **How does compaction affect overall performance?**

## Current Implementation Status

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="‚úÖ Ready for Benchmarking">
    - Basic MemTable operations - WAL write/read operations - Simple SSTable structure
  </TabItem>

<TabItem label="üöß Needed for Full Benchmarks">
  - SSTable reader implementation - Compaction strategy - Range query support - Proper error
  handling
</TabItem>

  <TabItem label="‚è≥ Future Optimizations">
    - Bloom filters for reads - Compression for SSTables - Block cache for hot data - Parallel
    compaction
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Benchmarking Tools We'll Use

```bash
# Rust's built-in benchmarking
cargo bench

# Custom timing for learning
cargo run --example benchmark_operations

# Memory profiling
cargo install cargo-instruments  # macOS
cargo instruments -t alloc --bench memtable_bench

# I/O analysis
sudo iotop -p $(pgrep ferrisdb)
```

## Educational Value

Our benchmarks will serve multiple purposes:

### For Blog Posts

- **Performance surprises** that teach concepts
- **Before/after optimization** comparisons
- **Trade-off discussions** (memory vs speed)

### For Understanding

- **Why LSM trees work** for write-heavy workloads
- **When simple solutions** outperform complex ones
- **How to profile** and identify bottlenecks

### For Future Developers

- **Baseline measurements** for improvements
- **Methodology examples** for other projects
- **Real-world performance** expectations

## Coming Soon

We'll publish benchmarks when we have:

1. ‚úÖ **Correct implementation** - All core features working
2. ‚è≥ **Meaningful workloads** - Realistic test scenarios
3. ‚è≥ **Proper tooling** - Automated benchmark suite
4. ‚è≥ **Analysis framework** - Understanding what the numbers mean

**Remember**: We're building for learning, not just speed. The most important metric is how well
FerrisDB teaches database concepts!
