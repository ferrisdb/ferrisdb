# FerrisDB Guidelines Update Summary

**Date**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Realign project guidelines with core value propositions

## What Changed

### New Core Philosophy

**From**: Building a database (product focus)  
**To**: Documenting the journey of building a database (process focus)

### Key Principles Added

1. **Journey Over Destination** - The building process is the product
2. **Factual vs. Aspirational** - Clear distinction between built and planned
3. **No Premature Documentation** - Don't document features that don't exist
4. **Tutorial-Driven Learning** - Merge concepts into hands-on tutorials

### Major Structural Changes

#### Content Strategy

- Added [content-strategy.md](content/content-strategy.md) as primary guide
- Added [information-architecture.md](content/information-architecture.md) for structure
- Added [website-maintenance-simple.md](workflow/website-maintenance-simple.md) for focused updates

#### Content Approach

- **Remove**: Installation, Configuration, API docs (nothing to install/configure)
- **Transform**: Database concepts → Integrated into tutorials
- **Emphasize**: Blog posts, tutorials, current status, journey documentation

### Information Architecture

**New Structure**:

```
Start Here (Story, Status, Vision)
├── Learn by Building (Tutorials with concepts)
├── The Journey (Blogs, insights, decisions)
├── Deep Dives (Optional technical details)
└── Get Involved (Contributing)
```

## Why These Changes

1. **Alignment with value props** - We're teaching, not selling
2. **Honesty** - Don't pretend features exist
3. **Engagement** - Story + hands-on learning > dry documentation
4. **Uniqueness** - Human-AI collaboration is our differentiator

## Impact on Existing Work

- Blog posts remain unchanged (already journey-focused)
- Tutorials enhanced to include concepts inline
- Remove speculative documentation
- Add clear status indicators everywhere

## Next Steps

1. Audit existing content against new guidelines
2. Remove/archive speculative documentation
3. Enhance tutorials with inline concepts
4. Create compelling "Start Here" experience
5. Update navigation to reflect journey focus

## Success Metrics

- Readers understand we're building, not selling
- Clear learning path from CRUD dev to database builder
- Human-AI collaboration visible throughout
- No confusion about what exists vs. planned
