# Testing Standards

This document outlines the testing requirements and standards for FerrisDB.

**Purpose**: Ensure code quality and prevent regressions through comprehensive testing practices.  
**Prerequisites**: Basic understanding of Rust's testing framework  
**Related**: [Code Style](../development/code-style.md), [PR Process](pr-process.md), [Commands](commands.md#testing)

## Test Requirements

### Minimum Coverage

- All public APIs must have tests
- Edge cases and error conditions must be tested
- Concurrent operations must have specific tests
- Recovery scenarios must be tested

### Test Organization

```rust
#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;

    #[test]
    fn test_basic_functionality() {
        // Test the happy path
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_edge_cases() {
        // Test boundary conditions
    }

    #[test]
    fn test_error_conditions() {
        // Test failure modes
    }
}
```

## Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --all

# Run with output
cargo test --all -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name

# Run tests in release mode
cargo test --release
```

## Test Categories

### Unit Tests

- Test individual functions and methods
- Keep tests close to the code they test
- Use descriptive test names

### Integration Tests

- Test interactions between components
- Place in `tests/` directory
- Test public API behavior

### Property-Based Tests

Consider using `proptest` for testing with arbitrary inputs:

```rust
use proptest::prelude::*;

proptest! {
    #[test]
    fn test_serialization_roundtrip(key: String, value: Vec<u8>) {
        // Test that serialization and deserialization are inverse operations
    }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Test names should describe what they test**

   ```rust
   // Good
   #[test]
   fn get_returns_none_for_missing_key() { }

   // Bad
   #[test]
   fn test_get() { }
   ```

2. **Use helper functions to reduce duplication**

   ```rust
   fn create_test_memtable() -> MemTable {
       // Common setup code
   }
   ```

3. **Test one thing at a time**

   - Each test should verify a single behavior
   - Multiple assertions are fine if testing related aspects

4. **Clean up resources**
   - Use RAII patterns for test resources
   - Clean up temporary files

## Continuous Integration

All tests run automatically on:

- Every push to a PR
- Before merging to main
- Nightly for extended test suites

Tests must pass before merging any PR.
