# Website Design Guidelines

**‚ö†Ô∏è DEPRECATED as of 2025-05-31**: This file is being replaced by [website-design-starlight.md](website-design-starlight.md) as part of the migration to Astro Starlight. This file will be removed after the migration is complete. Please use the new Starlight-specific guidelines for all new work.

Design guidelines for the FerrisDB documentation website, focusing on educational value and user engagement.

## Design Philosophy

- **Educational First**: Every design decision should make learning easier
- **Page-Turner Experience**: Content should be engaging and flow naturally
- **Transparent & Honest**: Show real progress, real mistakes, real learning
- **Human-AI Balance**: Showcase collaboration without overselling either side

## Visual Design

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: Use ONLY Just the Docs built-in utilities. No custom CSS allowed.

### Diagram Guidelines for Website

**CRITICAL**: Website content uses Mermaid diagrams for better visual presentation, but ALL Mermaid diagrams MUST be based on corresponding ASCII diagrams in the technical guidelines.

1. **Mermaid for Website Content**
   - Use Mermaid.js for blog posts, articles, and documentation pages
   - Provides cleaner rendering and better responsiveness
   - Supports interactive features and theming
2. **ASCII as Source of Truth**
   - Every Mermaid diagram must have an ASCII counterpart in technical guidelines
   - ASCII diagrams in `/guidelines/technical/` are authoritative
   - When updating diagrams, update ASCII first, then Mermaid
3. **Mermaid Syntax Examples**

   ```mermaid
   graph TD
       A[Client] --> B[Server]
       B --> C[Storage Engine]
       C --> D[MemTable]
       C --> E[SSTables]
       C --> F[WAL]
   ```

4. **Consistency Rules**
   - Node names must match between ASCII and Mermaid
   - Flow direction must be identical
   - All components shown in ASCII must appear in Mermaid
   - Labels and descriptions must align

### Implementation Status in Content

**MANDATORY**: When creating any content (blog posts, articles, documentation) that discusses features not yet implemented:

1. **Clear Status Markers**
   - Use **[PLANNED]**, **[CONCEPTUAL]**, or **[FUTURE]** tags
   - Place status at the beginning of sections
   - Use callout boxes for emphasis
2. **Example Patterns**

   ```markdown
   ## Transaction Support [PLANNED]

   > **Note**: This section describes planned functionality not yet implemented.

   In the future, FerrisDB will support ACID transactions...
   ```

3. **Avoid Misleading Claims**
   - Never present future features as current
   - Use future tense for unimplemented features
   - Be explicit about what exists vs. what's planned
4. **Update When Implemented**
   - Remove status markers when features land
   - Update tense from future to present
   - Add "Available since version X" notes

### Color Palette

Defined in `_sass/color_schemes/ferrisdb.scss` and applied automatically:

- **Primary**: Rust orange - use `.btn-primary` or `.text-purple-300`
- **Text**: High contrast dark gray - default text color
- **Backgrounds**: Use `.bg-grey-lt-000` for light sections

### Typography

Use Just the Docs utility classes:

- **Font Size**: `.fs-1` to `.fs-10` (9px to 48px)
- **Font Weight**: `.fw-300`, `.fw-400`, `.fw-500`, `.fw-700`
- **Small Text**: `.text-small` for meta information

### Layout

- **Spacing**: Use `.mb-*`, `.mt-*`, `.my-*` classes (1-8 scale)
- **Alignment**: Use `.text-center`, `.text-left`, `.text-right`
- **No custom containers**: Let Just the Docs handle max-width

## Content Structure

## ROADMAP.md as Source of Truth

The `ROADMAP.md` file is the SINGLE source of truth for ALL project progress displayed on the website. Never add progress information that isn't tracked in ROADMAP.md.

**ROADMAP.md Structure**:

- **Storage Engine Foundation**: Core database components (WAL, MemTable, SSTable, etc.)
- **Basic Operations**: CRUD operations and queries
- **ACID Transactions**: Transaction support and MVCC
- **Distribution Layer**: Distributed system features
- **Performance & Monitoring**: Metrics and benchmarking
- **Operations & Management**: Admin tools and utilities
- **Client & API**: Protocol and client libraries
- **Production Readiness**: Reliability features
- **Documentation & Examples**: Docs and learning materials
- **Educational Content**: Tutorials and guides

**Mapping ROADMAP.md to Website Content**:

1. ‚úÖ Items marked `[x]` ‚Üí "Available Now" / "What's Working" / "Core Concepts (Available Now)"
2. üöß Items marked `[ ]` in current focus areas ‚Üí "Currently Building" / "In Progress"
3. ‚è≥ Items in later sections ‚Üí "Coming Soon" / "Coming Next"

**ALL Progress Sections Must Update from ROADMAP.md**:

- `/index.md` ‚Üí "Latest Progress" section (lines 102-124) and "Development Progress" table (lines 97-108)
- `/start-here.md` ‚Üí "What You'll Learn" section (lines 32-50) and "What's implemented so far" section (lines 68-74)
- Any other page showing feature status

## Regular Maintenance Tasks

For detailed maintenance workflows, see [Website Maintenance](../workflow/website-maintenance.md).

### Quick Reference

- **Daily**: Update statistics and progress sections
- **Weekly**: Validate links and check progress accuracy
- **Monthly**: Full content review and navigation testing

### Update ALL Progress Sections from ROADMAP.md

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: ALL progress information on the website MUST be derived from ROADMAP.md. Never add features that aren't tracked there.

#### 1. Update `/start.md` Progress Sections

**"What You'll Learn" section (lines 32-50)**

1. Check ROADMAP.md for completed/in-progress items
2. Update three subsections:
   - **Core Concepts (Available Now)**: Completed items from "Storage Engine Foundation"
   - **Currently Building**: In-progress items from current focus areas
   - **Coming Soon**: Items from later ROADMAP.md sections
3. Transform technical terms into learner-friendly language:
   - "Write-Ahead Log (WAL)" ‚Üí "Why databases need Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) for crash recovery"
   - "MemTable (Skip List)" ‚Üí "How databases store data in memory with Skip Lists"
   - "SSTable format" ‚Üí "The SSTable format - how databases organize data on disk"
   - "Compaction" ‚Üí "Compaction - how databases merge files efficiently"
   - "Bloom filters" ‚Üí "Bloom filters - probabilistic data structures for speed"

**"What's implemented so far" section (lines 68-74)**

1. List completed items from ROADMAP.md with checkmarks
2. Show current work in progress
3. Mention what's coming next (interactive REPL when "CLI client" is ready)

#### 2. Update `/index.md` Progress Sections

**"Development Progress" table (lines 97-108)**:

1. Check ROADMAP.md for completed/in-progress items
2. Update table rows:
   - ‚úÖ Mark completed sections as "Complete"
   - üöß Mark sections with active work as "In Progress"
   - ‚è≥ Mark future sections as "Planned"
3. Include brief technical descriptions for each component

**"Latest Progress" section (if exists)**:

1. Check ROADMAP.md for completed/in-progress items
2. Update three subsections:
   - **‚úÖ What's Working**: All items marked `[x]` in ROADMAP.md
   - **üöß Currently Building**: Items marked `[ ]` in current focus areas (usually Storage Engine)
   - **‚è≥ Coming Next**: Next logical items from ROADMAP.md
3. Use technical descriptions (more detailed than start.md):
   - Include implementation details: "MemTable with concurrent Skip List"
   - Mention optimizations: "SSTable reader with binary search optimization"
   - Reference architectural decisions: "Clean API design after Day 2 refactoring"

#### 3. Check for Other Progress Sections

- Search for any other pages mentioning features or progress
- Ensure they all reference ROADMAP.md items only
- Update as needed to maintain consistency

### Language Guidelines for Progress Updates

**For `/start.md` (learner-focused)**

- Use "why" and "how" framing
- Explain the purpose of each feature
- Make it accessible to CRUD developers
- Example: "Why databases need Write-Ahead Logs" not just "WAL implemented"

**For `/index.md` (technically accurate)**

- Use precise technical terms
- Include implementation details
- Mention specific algorithms or data structures
- Example: "MemTable with concurrent Skip List" not just "in-memory storage"
