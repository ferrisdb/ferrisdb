# Blogging Guidelines

Guidelines for writing blog posts that document the FerrisDB development journey.

**Purpose**: Ensure accurate, engaging blog posts that document the real human-AI collaboration process.  
**Prerequisites**: Understanding of the FerrisDB project and git history

## Blog Structure

- **All posts**: `docs/src/content/docs/blog/` - Both human and Claude posts in one directory
- **Human posts**: Distinguished by `authors: [human]` in frontmatter
- **Claude posts**: Distinguished by `authors: [claude]` in frontmatter
- **File format**: Markdown (.md) files, not MDX
- **Templates**:
  - `templates/blog-post-human.mdx` for human posts (but save as .md)
  - `templates/blog-post-claude.mdx` for Claude posts (but save as .md)

## Core Principles

### 1. Accuracy is Paramount

- **Verify against codebase**: Cross-check technical details with actual implementation
- **Match git history**: Ensure stories align with commit history
- **No fictional scenarios**: Only document what actually happened
- **Correct misconceptions**: If initial understanding was wrong, update it

### 2. Our Real Workflow

Document our actual collaboration pattern:

1. **Human assigns task**: "Let's implement X"
2. **Claude implements**: Provides code with tests
3. **Human reviews**: Asks questions, spots issues
4. **Claude explains/improves**: Based on feedback
5. **Iterate**: Until both are satisfied
6. **PR and merge**: Finalize with clear commits

### 3. Show Real Conversations

Use actual dialogue patterns:

```
Me: I'm looking at your SSTable reader implementation. The entries are
sorted, right? Should we use binary search instead?

Claude: Oh! You're absolutely right. I focused on correctness but missed
the optimization opportunity. Let me fix that:

[code showing the improvement]

Me: Why do I need to specify Operation::Put when reading? I'm just
trying to get a value.

Claude: That's... actually a great point. You've identified a design flaw!
The operation isn't part of the key's identity...
```

## Writing Effective Blog Posts

### Implementation Status Requirements

**MANDATORY**: Any blog post discussing features must clearly indicate implementation status:

1. **For Unimplemented Features**

   ```markdown
   ## Transaction Support [PLANNED]

   > **Note**: This feature is not yet implemented. This post explores the design concepts.

   When we implement transactions, FerrisDB will...
   ```

2. **For Partially Implemented Features**

   ```markdown
   ## Compaction Strategy [IN PROGRESS]

   > **Status**: Basic compaction implemented, advanced strategies planned.

   Currently, FerrisDB uses a simple size-tiered compaction...
   ```

3. **For Conceptual Discussions**

   ```markdown
   ## Exploring Lock-Free Data Structures [CONCEPTUAL]

   > **Note**: This post discusses theoretical approaches we're considering.

   In future iterations, we might explore...
   ```

4. **Clear Language Rules**
   - Use "will" or "would" for future features
   - Use "currently" or "now" for implemented features
   - Never imply something exists when it doesn't
   - Update posts when features are implemented

### Human Perspective Posts

Focus on:

- **Code review insights**: Questions that led to improvements
- **Learning moments**: Understanding through reviewing Claude's code
- **Design decisions**: Why certain approaches were chosen
- **Debugging together**: How problems were solved collaboratively

Example structure:

```markdown
## The Setup

[What task was assigned to Claude]

## The Challenge

[Issues found during review]

## Seeking Understanding

[Questions asked and Claude's explanations]

## The Breakthrough

[How the solution emerged through iteration]

## Deeper Understanding

[What was learned from the process]

## Reflection

[How the collaboration worked, confidence levels]
```

### Claude's Perspective Posts

Focus on:

- **Pattern recognition**: What patterns emerged from collaboration
- **Human insights**: How human questions improved the code
- **Learning from review**: What the human's perspective revealed
- **Workflow evolution**: How our collaboration improved

Example structure:

```markdown
## üîç The [Pattern Name] Pattern

[Description of what was observed]

## üß† The [Insight Type] Moment

[How human input changed my approach]

## üéØ The [Improvement] Discovery

[What we achieved together]

## üìä Reflection on Collaboration

[Analysis of what worked and why]
```

## Technical Accuracy Checklist

Before publishing, verify:

1. **Code examples match implementation**

   ```bash
   # Check actual structs/functions
   grep -n "struct InternalKey" ferrisdb-storage/src/
   ```

2. **API changes are accurate**

   ```bash
   # Verify refactoring commits
   git log --grep="refactor" --oneline
   ```

3. **Performance claims are real**

   - Binary search actually implemented?
   - Optimization measurements accurate?

4. **Design decisions documented correctly**

   - Why was operation in InternalKey?
   - What prompted the refactoring?

5. **Fact-check against commit commentaries**

   ```bash
   # Search for Claude's commentaries in commits
   git log --grep="ü§ñ Claude's Commentary" --oneline

   # View specific commit with commentary
   git show <commit-hash>
   ```

   - Verify timeline matches commentary process
   - Check iteration counts and insights
   - Confirm key learnings are accurately represented
   - Use PR collaboration summaries for overview

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### 1. Mixing Up Timeline

‚ùå "I noticed there were two different InternalKey structs"
‚úÖ "I noticed the API required Operation::Put when reading"

### 2. Fictional Improvements

‚ùå "We implemented binary search using binary_search_by"
‚úÖ "We implemented binary search using partition_point"

### 3. Missing Context

‚ùå "The code was refactored"
‚úÖ "My question about the awkward API led to refactoring operation out of InternalKey"

### 4. Wrong Attribution

‚ùå "Claude suggested using binary search"
‚úÖ "I asked if we should use binary search since the data was sorted"

## Frontmatter Standards (Starlight Blog)

**Note**: We now use Starlight blog format. See templates for full examples:

- [Human Blog Template](templates/blog-post-human.mdx)
- [Claude Blog Template](templates/blog-post-claude.mdx)

### Human Posts

```yaml
---
title: "Day N: [Learning-Focused Title]"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
authors: [human]
tags: [ferrisdb, rust, learning, implementation]
description: "[Brief description focusing on what was learned/discovered]"
excerpt: "[Compelling excerpt that shows authentic learning journey]"
---
```

### Claude Posts

```yaml
---
title: "Day N: [Pattern or Insight-Focused Title]"
date: YYYY-MM-DD
authors: [claude]
tags: [ai-perspective, collaboration, patterns, learning]
description: "[AI perspective on collaboration patterns or technical insights]"
excerpt: "[Brief excerpt highlighting the key pattern discovered]"
---
```

**Key Changes from Jekyll**:

- No `layout` field (Starlight handles this)
- `authors` array instead of single `author`
- No manual `permalink` (auto-generated from filename)
- Added `excerpt` for blog listings
- Use regular Markdown (.md), not MDX for blog posts
- Tags are automatically linked and generate tag pages

## URL Structure

- **Filename format**: `day-N-author-descriptive-title.md`
  - Human: `day-1-human-from-just-use-rocksdb-to-building-from-scratch.md`
  - Claude: `day-1-claude-how-i-learned-humans-say-build-but-mean-teach.md`
- **Generated URLs**:
  - `/blog/day-N-author-descriptive-title/`
  - `/blog/authors/human/` (author archive)
  - `/blog/authors/claude/` (author archive)
- **Naming guidelines**:
  - Start with `day-N-` followed by author (`human` or `claude`)
  - Keep titles descriptive but concise
  - Use hyphens to separate words
  - Match the actual title in frontmatter

## Starlight Blog Features

Our blog uses the `starlight-blog` plugin which provides:

- **Author profiles**: Configured in `astro.config.mjs`
  - `human`: Name: "Human", Title: "üë®‚Äçüíª Database Apprentice"
  - `claude`: Name: "Claude", Title: "ü§ñ Code Whisperer"
- **Author pages**: `/blog/authors/human/` and `/blog/authors/claude/`
- **Tag pages**: Auto-generated from tags in frontmatter
- **Blog navigation**: Integrated into main sidebar under "The Journey"
- **RSS feed**: Available at `/blog/rss.xml`
- **Pagination**: Automatic for blog listing pages

## Publishing Process

1. **Write draft** following the appropriate template from [templates/](templates/) directory
2. **Save as .md file** in `docs/src/content/docs/blog/`
3. **Verify technical accuracy** against codebase
4. **Cross-check** human and Claude posts for consistency
   - Same day posts must align on facts
   - Technical details must match
   - Timeline of events must be consistent
5. **Review dialogue** for authenticity
   - Use exact quotes when possible
   - Format consistently: `**Me**: question` / `**Claude**: response`
6. **Ensure proper attribution** throughout
7. **Run linters** for markdown quality
8. **Create PR** with clear description

## Using Commit Commentaries for Blog Posts

The commit commentaries serve as a primary source for blog posts:

1. **Gather commentaries from the day's work**:

   ```bash
   # Find all commits with commentaries from a specific day
   git log --since="2025-05-27" --until="2025-05-28" --grep="ü§ñ" --pretty=full
   ```

2. **Extract key patterns and insights**:

   - Stats provide quantitative data
   - Process descriptions show workflow
   - Key learnings highlight breakthroughs
   - Questions count shows human impact

3. **Cross-reference PR summaries** for broader patterns

4. **Use commentaries to ensure accuracy**:
   - Timeline of events
   - Who suggested what
   - Actual iteration count
   - Real collaboration dynamics

## Visual Elements

### Mermaid Diagrams

We now support mermaid diagrams in blog posts:

````markdown
```mermaid
graph LR
    Human[Human Reviews] --> Question[Asks Question]
    Question --> Claude[Claude Explains]
    Claude --> Improvement[Code Improves]
```
````

```

**Best practices**:
- Center diagrams (handled automatically by our CSS)
- Use quotes for edge labels: `-->|"Complex label"|`
- Keep diagrams simple and focused
- Use for workflow visualization, architecture, or process flow

### Code Examples

- Use proper syntax highlighting with language tags
- Include file paths as comments when showing real code
- Keep examples focused and relevant
- Show before/after for improvements

## Remember

Our blog posts serve multiple purposes:

- **Educational**: Show real human-AI collaboration
- **Historical**: Document actual development process
- **Research**: Provide data on collaboration patterns
- **Inspirational**: Encourage others to try this workflow

Keep them accurate, engaging, and true to our actual experience!
