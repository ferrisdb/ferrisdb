# Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Implementation

This module implements the Write-Ahead Log for FerrisDB, providing durability guarantees for all write operations.

## Current Implementation Status

The WAL currently provides:
- ‚úÖ Basic write and read operations
- ‚úÖ CRC32 checksums for corruption detection
- ‚úÖ Configurable sync modes (None, Normal, Full)
- ‚úÖ Thread-safe concurrent writes
- ‚úÖ Size-based rotation triggers
- ‚úÖ Partial entry handling during recovery

## WAL Format Specification v0 (Current)

### Entry Format
```
+------------+------------+------------+-------+------------+
| Length(4B) | CRC32(4B)  | Time(8B)   | Op(1B)| Key Len(4B)|
+------------+------------+------------+-------+------------+
| Key(var)   | Val Len(4B)| Value(var) |
+------------+------------+------------+
```

**Note**: Current format has no file header or version information.

## Improvement Roadmap

### Phase 1: File Header and Versioning ‚è≥

- [ ] Add magic number (0x57414C21 / "WAL!")
- [ ] Add version field for format evolution
- [ ] Add file header structure:
  ```rust
  struct WALHeader {
      magic: u32,         // 0x57414C21 ("WAL!")
      version: u32,       // Format version (start with 1)
      flags: u32,         // Feature flags (compression, encryption)
      page_size: u32,     // For future page-based I/O
      creation_time: u64, // When WAL was created
      checksum: u32,      // Header checksum
  }
  ```
- [ ] Implement header validation on open
- [ ] Support reading v0 (headerless) files for migration
- [ ] Add version compatibility checks
- [ ] Update documentation with format specification

### Phase 2: Log Sequence Numbers (LSN) üìã

- [ ] Replace timestamp-only sequencing with proper LSN
- [ ] Add LSN to entry structure:
  ```rust
  pub struct WALEntry {
      pub lsn: u64,        // Monotonic byte offset
      pub prev_lsn: u64,   // Previous entry's LSN (for consistency)
      pub timestamp: u64,  // Wall clock time (keep for debugging)
      pub operation: Operation,
      pub key: Key,
      pub value: Value,
  }
  ```
- [ ] Implement LSN tracking in writer
- [ ] Add gap detection in reader
- [ ] Support partial replay from specific LSN
- [ ] Add LSN-based consistency checks

### Phase 3: Automatic Rotation üîÑ

- [ ] Implement segment-based file naming (wal.00000001, wal.00000002)
- [ ] Add automatic rotation when size limit reached
- [ ] Create `WALManager` to coordinate multiple files:
  ```rust
  pub struct WALManager {
      base_path: PathBuf,
      current_segment: u64,
      current_writer: WALWriter,
      segment_size: u64,
      retention_policy: RetentionPolicy,
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add retention policies (keep last N files, time-based)
- [ ] Implement cleanup of old segments
- [ ] Add segment discovery during recovery
- [ ] Support reading across multiple segments

### Phase 4: Page-Based I/O üìÑ

- [ ] Implement fixed-size page structure (8KB default)
- [ ] Add page headers with metadata:
  ```rust
  struct WALPage {
      lsn: u64,           // First LSN in page
      prev_page_lsn: u64, // For consistency
      checksum: u32,      // Page checksum
      flags: u16,         // Page flags
      remaining: u16,     // Bytes remaining in page
  }
  ```
- [ ] Support entries spanning multiple pages
- [ ] Implement aligned I/O for performance
- [ ] Add page-level corruption recovery
- [ ] Enable direct I/O support (bypass OS cache)

### Phase 5: Performance Optimizations üöÄ

- [ ] Implement group commit / write batching:
  ```rust
  pub struct BatchedWALWriter {
      pending: Vec<WALEntry>,
      last_flush: Instant,
      max_batch_size: usize,
      max_delay: Duration,
  }
  ```
- [ ] Add write combining for small entries
- [ ] Implement parallel recovery (partition by key)
- [ ] Add compression support (LZ4, Snappy)
- [ ] Optimize memory allocation patterns
- [ ] Add zero-copy paths where possible

### Phase 6: Advanced Features üîß

- [ ] Add encryption support (at-rest encryption)
- [ ] Implement WAL archiving for backup
- [ ] Add replication support (streaming WAL)
- [ ] Support point-in-time recovery
- [ ] Add WAL inspection tools
- [ ] Implement WAL compression
- [ ] Add metrics and monitoring hooks

## Migration Strategy

### From v0 to v1 (Adding Headers)

1. **Detection**: Check first 4 bytes for magic number
2. **Migration**: If no magic, assume v0 format
3. **Compatibility**: Support reading both formats
4. **Upgrade**: Rewrite with header on next rotation

### Future Version Upgrades

1. **Version Check**: Refuse to open incompatible versions
2. **Migration Tool**: Provide offline conversion utility
3. **Online Upgrade**: Support live format upgrades
4. **Rollback**: Keep old format until confirmed stable

## Testing Requirements

### Current Tests ‚úÖ
- Unit tests for encode/decode
- Integration tests for write/read
- Concurrent write tests
- Corruption detection tests
- Edge case tests (disk full, etc.)

### Additional Tests Needed üìù
- [ ] Version migration tests
- [ ] Multi-segment recovery tests
- [ ] Page boundary tests
- [ ] Performance regression tests
- [ ] Crash recovery scenarios
- [ ] Replication tests

## Performance Targets

### Current Performance
- Single-threaded writes: ~50K ops/sec (SyncMode::None)
- Concurrent writes: Serialized through mutex
- Recovery speed: ~100K entries/sec

### Target Performance
- [ ] Group commit: 200K+ ops/sec
- [ ] Parallel recovery: 500K+ entries/sec
- [ ] Page-based I/O: 2x throughput improvement
- [ ] Direct I/O: Predictable latency

## API Stability

### Stable APIs (v1.0)
- `WALWriter::new()`
- `WALWriter::append()`
- `WALReader::new()`
- `WALReader::read_all()`
- `WALEntry` structure

### Unstable APIs (subject to change)
- Internal encoding format
- File naming scheme
- Recovery strategies
- Performance optimizations
