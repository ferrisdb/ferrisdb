# Content Audit Progress Report

## ✅ Phase 1: Remove Misleading Content (COMPLETE)

Successfully removed all premature documentation:

- ❌ `reference/configuration.mdx` - No configuration exists
- ❌ `reference/architecture.mdx` - Described unbuilt distributed system
- ❌ `guides/installation.mdx` - Nothing to install
- ❌ `benchmarks.mdx` - No benchmarks exist
- ❌ `reference/storage-engine.mdx` - Mixed real and aspirational
- ❌ `getting-started.mdx` - Suggested running non-existent operations
- ❌ `tutorial.mdx` - Implied you could run queries

## ✅ Phase 2: Create Honest Status (COMPLETE)

Created clear, factual documentation:

- ✅ `status.mdx` - Honest current state with clear built/not built
- ✅ `reference/current-implementation.mdx` - What actually exists in code
- ✅ `exploring-ferrisdb.mdx` - How to explore the codebase (not use it)
- ✅ Updated homepage - Journey focus, clear status, learning emphasis
- ✅ Updated roadmap - Journey documentation, not promises

## 🚧 Phase 3: Transform Concepts (IN PROGRESS)

Still need to merge database concepts into tutorials:

- `concepts/database-internals/lsm-trees.mdx`
- `concepts/database-internals/skip-lists.mdx`
- `concepts/database-internals/sstables.mdx`
- `concepts/database-internals/wal.mdx`
- `concepts/rust-patterns/ownership-sharing.mdx`

Plan: Create tutorials that teach these concepts through building.

## 📋 Phase 4: Final Polish (TODO)

- Update navigation/sidebar configuration
- Ensure all cross-references work
- Review against content strategy one final time
- Update FAQ to be factual

## Summary of Changes

### Documentation Philosophy Shift

**Before**: Product documentation for a database that doesn't exist
**After**: Journey documentation of learning to build a database

### Key Improvements

1. **Honesty** - Clear about what's built vs planned
2. **Learning Focus** - Tutorials and exploration, not usage
3. **Journey Narrative** - Story of building, not features
4. **Appropriate Expectations** - Educational project, not production database

### Content Structure

```
OLD:
├── Installation Guide (doesn't exist)
├── Configuration Reference (not built)
├── Architecture Overview (aspirational)
├── Getting Started (can't start anything)
└── Benchmarks (no benchmarks)

NEW:
├── Current Status (what actually exists)
├── Exploring FerrisDB (learn from code)
├── Development Journey (blog & roadmap)
├── Learn by Building (tutorials)
└── Vision (clearly marked future)
```

## Next Steps

1. **Merge concepts into tutorials** - Most important remaining work
2. **Create more tutorials** - WAL, MemTable, SSTable explorations
3. **Update navigation** - Reflect new structure
4. **Polish cross-references** - Ensure consistency

## Impact

The documentation now:

- ✅ Accurately represents the project state
- ✅ Focuses on the learning journey
- ✅ Sets appropriate expectations
- ✅ Highlights the unique human-AI collaboration
- ✅ Invites participation in learning, not usage

This aligns perfectly with our value propositions and content strategy!
